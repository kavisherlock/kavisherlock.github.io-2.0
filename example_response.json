System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and selected by The New York Times Book Review as one of the ten best books of 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow is destined to be a classic.",

This is the summarized version of Daniel Kahneman's international bestseller, \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\", in which the author reveals how the mind works and the two systems that drive the way we think.

    "description": "In recent research, dual-process theories of cognition have been the primary model for explaining moral judgment and reasoning. These theories understand moral thinking in terms of two separate domains: one deliberate and analytic, the other quick and instinctive. This book presents a new theory of the philosophy and cognitive science of moral judgment. Hanno Sauer develops and defends an account of \"triple-process\" moral psychology, arguing that moral thinking and reasoning are only insufficiently understood when described in terms of a quick but intuitive and a slow but rational type of cognition. This approach severely underestimates the importance and impact of dispositions to initiate and engage in critical thinking – the cognitive resource in charge of counteracting my-side bias, closed-mindedness, dogmatism, and breakdowns of self-control. Moral cognition is based, not on emotion and reason, but on an integrated network of intuitive, algorithmic and reflective thinking. Moral Thinking, Fast and Slow will be of great interest to philosophers and students of ethics, philosophy of psychology and cognitive science.",

Daniel won a Economics Nobel Prize award. The main topic of the book is the way humans think, which influences our daily lives. The work presents the dichotomy between two ways of thinking, which the author calls 'systems'. The first system is fast, instinctive and emotional, the second one is slow, more rational and logical. Each of these entails cognitive and behavioural characteristics. From a highly original and logical hypothesis, a vision is presented which shapes the routine of decision-making that people make in their daily lives. This book is recommended for professionals in the psychology field. As well as for anyone interested in knowing themselves better and the processes involved in their decisions, with the means to acquire tools which allow them to reach the path leading to their happiness.",

His award-winning book explains the different ways people think, whether they’re deciding how to invest their money or how to make friends. Kahneman’s experiments in behavioral economics, in collaboration with cognitive psychologist Amos Tversky, led to a theory of two systems of thought: the fast thinking used when ducking a blow, and slow thinking that’s better employed for making major life decisions. Applying these psychological concepts to different facets of our lives, Kahneman demonstrates how to better understand your own decision-making, and the choices made by others. The summary and analysis in this ebook are intended to complement your reading experience and bring you closer to great work of nonfiction.",

    "description": "Thinking, Fast and Slow - A Complete and Detailed Summary! The first chapter begins with Daniel Kahneman's description of two main characters of the book, neither of which are people. He refers to something that he calls System 1 and System 2. System 1 is dedicated to thinking fast. It almost solely relies on intuition and almost entirely disregards information. System 1 is in control every time we do an activity that requires quick thinking and reactions. For example, System 1 in in control when we drive, when we want to read other people's facial expressions, when we answer to questions that require quick answers, etc. Kahneman states that System 1 is involuntary and operates entirely on its own. System 2 thinks slowly and always relies on information and almost never on intuition. System 2 is in control when we try to solve difficult math problem, when we want to focus our attention on the voice of person in a room full of people, when we fill in tax forms, or during any other events that are based on awareness. System 2 requires energy, because it operates voluntarily. Here Is a Preview of What You Will Get: - A summarized version of the book, with approx. 60 pages. - You will find the book analyzed to further strengthen your knowledge. - Fun multiple-choice quizzes, along with answers to help you learn about the book. Get a copy, and learn everything about Thinking, Fast and Slow.",

Lewis has given us a spectacular account of two great men who faced up to uncertainty and the limits of human reason.” —William Easterly, Wall Street Journal Forty years ago, Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky wrote a series of breathtakingly original papers that invented the field of behavioral economics. One of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, Kahneman and Tversky’s extraordinary friendship incited a revolution in Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis’s own work possible. In The Undoing Project, Lewis shows how their Nobel Prize–winning theory of the mind altered our perception of reality.",

    "description": "Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist and Nobel Prize winner, is the author of the fascinating book “Thinking, Fast, and Slow.” In general, when we make decisions, be it personally or professionally, all of us utilize two basic thinking systems for problem-solving, and the importance of utilizing the right system. This book is all about two basic thinking systems. The first system is Fast Thinking and the second system is Slow Thinking. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 11.0px 'Trebuchet MS'; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000} span.s1 {font-kerning: none} In short, Fast Thinking is what our “gut” tells us what we should do. It is intuitive, emotional, and done with little thought or effort. Slow thinking is slow, deliberate, and logical. It usually takes more time, often includes numerical or factual information that our brain needs to process and is void of emotion. Kahneman expresses the importance of making it a habit to train our brains into using the right way of “thinking” as we make decisions, as utilizing the wrong thinking system can lead to poor or even disastrous consequences. Kahneman, through intensive behavioral study, has determined that people are more successful if they can lean on the Slow Thinking method. Kahneman teaches his proven theory simply, and includes a plan of action for learning to train the brain to use the correct “thinking” system. This novel takes a fascinating look at behaviors that can change our lives - personally, professionally, and financially. It is a book you should read to improve and utilize your thinking system the right way.",
